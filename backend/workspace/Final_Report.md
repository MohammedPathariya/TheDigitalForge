# Client-Facing Report: `calculate_average` Function Development

## Summary of the Development Process
In the course of this project, we aimed to develop a Python function, `calculate_average`, designed to compute the average value from a list of numbers. Our initial brief outlined the objectives and requirements, including proper error handling for empty lists and ensuring syntactic correctness.

The development was carried out as planned, with the core function implemented according to specifications. However, we encountered some issues with the testing phase, which led to failed tests. Below are the details of the outcome and relevant code.

## Final Outcome
Process completed with failing tests. The code below is the latest iteration and may not be fully functional.

```

### Final Code
Here is the final implemented code for the `calculate_average` function in `math_helpers.py`:

```python
def calculate_average(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        raise ValueError("Input list cannot be empty")
    return sum(numbers) / len(numbers)
```

### Complete Test Suite
Below is the complete testing suite that was designed to validate the functionality within `test_math_helpers.py`:

```python
import pytest
from math_helpers import calculate_average

# Test for valid input with non-empty list.
def test_valid_input():
    assert calculate_average([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == 3.0

# Test with floats in the input list.
def test_floats_input():
    assert calculate_average([1.5, 2.5, 3.5]) == 2.5

# Test with a single number in the list.
def test_single_input():
    assert calculate_average([10]) == 10.0

# Test for handling of an empty list.
def test_empty_list():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError) as excinfo:
        calculate_average([])
    assert str(excinfo.value) == 'Input list cannot be empty'
```
