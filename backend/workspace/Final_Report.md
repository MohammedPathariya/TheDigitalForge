# Final Client Report for Email Format Validation

## Summary of Development Process
The project aimed to develop a Python function that validates email address formats. The requirements were clearly defined in the initial brief, which outlined the core objectives, key features, and success criteria for the function. Throughout the development process, we adhered to the specifications, ensuring that the function created meets the set expectations and standards for code quality. We implemented proper testing to confirm the functionality of the code, which enhances the reliability of the email validation process.

## Final Outcome
All tests passed successfully.

## Final Code
```python
def validate_email(email):
    import re
    # Basic regex for validating an Email
    pattern = r'^[a-zA-Z0-9._%+-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9.-]+\.[a-zA-Z]{2,}$'
    return re.match(pattern, email) is not None
```

## Test Suite
```python
import pytest
from email_validator import validate_email  # Adjust the import based on your actual function name

@pytest.mark.parametrize("email_input, expected_output", [
    ('test@example.com', True),  # Test for valid email with standard format
    ('test.example.com', False),  # Test for email missing '@' symbol
    ('test@@example.com', False),  # Test for email with multiple '@' symbols
    ('test@example', False),  # Test for email with '@' but no '.' after it
    ('@example.com', False),  # Test for email with only '@' symbol
    ('example.com', False),  # Test for email with only a domain
    ('', False)  # Test for empty string as input
])
def test_email_validator(email_input, expected_output):
    assert validate_email(email_input) == expected_output
```
